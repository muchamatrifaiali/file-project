#Sure, here is an example of the code you need for Python to generate KML file from Excel:

import os 
import simplekml 
import xlrd 
# Create an instance of the KML class 
kml = simplekml.Kml() 
# open workbook 
wb = xlrd.open_workbook("data.xls") 
# get the first sheet 
sh = wb.sheet_by_index(0) 
# Iterate through the rows in the Excel sheet 
for rx in range(sh.nrows): 
# get the values from the row 
name, desc, lat, lon, elev = sh.row_values(rx) 
# Create the point 
pnt = kml.newpoint(name=name, description=desc, coords=[(lon, lat, elev)]) 
# save the KML file 
kml.save("data.kml").
